# Grading
AI Grading Tool based on complex socio-technical framework FRAM 

# AI Grading Tool (MVP)

This project aims to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an AI-assisted grading system that models human grading behavior using the **Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM)**. The system will support high-variability grading contexts such as high school math explanations and college-level logic proofs.

## ðŸ§  Project Goals

- Reduce grading time and human bias.
- Improve feedback quality and consistency.
- Understand and simulate grader variability using FRAM.
- Incorporate OCR and AI logic to assist and eventually automate grading functions.
